<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">This is for the
information as for the mailing of parcels for the e-bay auctions
and will follow after brief information section for those who
feel that time is on their side!</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">Pardon me and I
apologize for what you are about to read for those of you that
have grown to know the business that I maintain here at the shop.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center"><FONT COLOR="#000000">There
have been several people that do not read the descriptions of
the auctions that I place on E-bay. Sometimes I do make a mistake
for the shipping and do on occasions make a mistake in the area
of the typing of material and the sizes and etc. But make no mistake
when it comes to the time of the commitment towards getting the
auctions completed and paid for. The time limit is there for a
reason and still several people ignore the statement that the
transaction must be paid for and the auction completed in 10 days
unless arrangements have been made ahead of time. With people
who are wanting open boxes it has now come down to the fact that
there will be only 14 days for these accounts of which at the
end of those 14 days all accounts and auctions are and will be
paid from now on! This being that some bidders are thinking that
an open box is a way to be able to win just a couple of auctions
over a long period of time or months and this has been abused
by many and has been abused to the point that this kind of open
box is no longer available. Anything in an open box that has not
been taken care and paid for within the open box time limit is
now subject to storage and handling fees that will be assessed
on the amount of the total sum of the said auctions. The fee for
storage and handling will be 15% of the auction or auctions total
and will be no less than $4.00 at anytime. It is because of bidders
taking weeks and even months to pay off their winnings, as I have
had to pay for all the fees of the auctions before they have decided
to send in their payments. Operating on my capital will no longer
be tolerated because it costs me long before it costs you in making
your payments for these auctions. This of course is unless you
have made previous arrangements ahead of time for a longer period
of time on the open box. Some who have ignored this have been
given a non-paying bidder to E-bay and some have left their posts
as for their e-mail address and leaving behind a great some of
auctions with an even greater dollar amount than the others as
a game, I think! This I assure you will not be tolerated here
at the shop any further. This kind of a joke will be met with
stiff penalties from E-bay and myself when we catch you.  The
auctions as in the format that you have agreed to on E-bay in
signing up is a contract and are subject to all the legal matters
the same as any written contract when it comes to not complying
with the agreement of E-bay and or the seller.</FONT></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center"><BR>
For those of you that have been bidding with me for several occasions
or a new comer, I must apologize for this inconvenience of having
you to read this!</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">For you and your
bidding as well as winning, I commend you! I have the highest
respect and admirations for your patronage and do hope that I
can offer you the materials and the service that you have grown
to expect from us here at the shop.<BR>
Thank you!</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">With every item
and the auctions of these items, we try and take great care in
placing your items in bubble wrap and peanuts so as to try and
make sure of a safe delivery. This is as everyone knows costs
money. If you feel that the shipping charges are a bit more than
you feel is as a norm, please e-mail us for an explanation and
you shall be informed. We may charge a bit more but I assure you
that we care about the items to be able to get them to you in
the same condition that you see in the pictures on the auctions
and the shipping of non-auction items as well.<BR>
All International and Canadian patrons MUST e-mail us for the
shipping charges as this type of shipping can be very expensive
and shouldn't be calculated by yourself as the charges maybe different
from one country to another.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">ATTENTION ABOUT
CANADIAN PAYMENTS Canadian buyers, please be advised that for
some reason when it comes to checks and or money orders drawn
on Canadian Banks or Canadian Money Order Banks that there is
a very large exchange rate that I feel is way to much to bare
in accepting payments from said Canadian Branches. What this means
is that with our neighbors in Canada that the way you are to make
said payments for auctions and or purchases with Triple A Rockshop
is with a check or money order that is drawn on an American Bank
within the Canadian Borders. Any payments written on a Canadian
Bank or Money Order House that is not an American held bank will
be returned with an added charge for postage till payments are
made from a US Bank or by some other means. This is why we have
made Pay-Pal our choice for the Canadian neighbors and also using
Visa and/or Master Card as another form of payments without the
exchange rates. I am sorry for this but we have experienced some
very large costs in the past that has forced us to adapt this
policy. Again, I am truly sorry for this inconvenience for the
postage and the payments for e-bay auctions.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">1. If a small cabochon
or several cabs in a single parcel or slab is the item mailed,
we send now in a small bubble wrap envelope as first class mail
for $4.00 upon request, other wise it is sent Priority Mail which
is $5.00 as a minimum.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">2. All other items
are shipped by Priority mail as for the weight and shall be determined
by e-mailing us for that total. (This is a must for those of you
that win several items.) At times this can be as much as a couple
of items from the auctions and still be only a $5.00 charge for
the mailing. Then there are at times the weight can be such that
by sending items by priority mail can and will be higher. As for
that charge it will and is based on the weight through the United
States Postal Service.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">3. With several
items or auctions and the weight is heavier than the mail will
allow us to send as to the costs, we then look for the least amount
of shipping for you with United Parcel Service or with a shipping
contractor as we don't like to spend anymore of your money than
we have too. FEDEX WILL NOT BE CONTACTED AS THEIR ACCOUNT HAS
BEEN CLOSED WITH US HERE AT THE SHOP!!</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">4. IF YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS AT ALL ABOUT SHIPPING, PLEASE CONTACT US BY E-MAIL
OR PHONE SO AS WE CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS FOR AN EASY RESOLVE.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">5. Since our shop
is always humming and the work is always mounting up, we ship
only once a week as for the United States Postal Service (USPS)
and as well as the main shippers of UPS and /or separate contractors.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">6. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE
SHOULD YOU TRY AND CALCULATE THE SHIPPING FOR SEVERAL ITEMS OR
EVEN ONE AUCTION AS THIS IS GETTING A BIT EXSPENSIVE FOR US, HERE
AT THE SHOP. This will not be tolerated any further and as for
those who do this will have their auctions kept here at the shop
till the balance has been paid in full before the items are sent
or shipped. When a payment has been made by way of Pay-Pal and
a bidder figured the shipping without e-mailing us for the shipping
charges there will be an assessment and/or storage fee placed
upon the auction or auctions for doing this from now on till the
auction or auctions are paid in full. In the past we have been
short on the mailing fees and have been told by the patrons that
they will send the extra to make up the balance only to be forgotten.
Again this will no longer be tolerated! </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">7. There has been
several bidders that have been asking for a payment plan or credit
plan for the items on the auctions and for items on the website.
We are not a bank and do not give CREDIT to anyone for anything
and we do not have approval ordering or purchasing.<BR>
<BR>
8. While shipping Priority Mail there can be a loss in the mail
and with this it can't really be found unless you have a confirmation
or some way to track the parcel. This is of course, is to have
us put a delivery confirmation on your parcel or insurance as
it does help and this will be an added expense to your auctions.
Even with this we are not responsible for the shippers or the
United States Postal Service for the lost items. This we will
look at with any complication and will address the situation with
each individual problem or issue. If you choose to not have the
confirmation or insurance added, as we will e-mail you with the
totals of auctions and the shipping ONLY!!!! It will be up to
you to add the fees or just request a total with the confirmation
and/or insurance fees as well before the total payment is sent
to us for the said auction or auctions.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">9.  The reason
we have had to go to charging the fees for storage and or handling
fees is because long before you pay the auctions off. I have already
paid for all the fees of the auction insertion fees which is up
by 10%, the end of auction fees and percentage is up 5%, E-bay
program fee has doubled, then the credit card fees and interest
is up 1.5 percent. Then to have someone take as much as 1-3 months
to make his or her payment for the auctions is too much cost for
me to bare anymore. I offer quality goods at sometimes-lower prices
than what I have paid for the goods placed on E-bay so as my clients
have the opportunity to bid up the auctions and still get a good
deal. When you do this and then find out that they take up to
1-3 months and sometimes longer to pay for their winnings you
have lost all profits and then the amount of money for the auctions
doesn't even cover the expenses. This is the reason for the storage
and handling fees and will be in force from now on. I apologize
and I am sorry about this but what must be done must be done!</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">10.  RETURNING
AUCTIONS, if at anytime there is a problem with what you have
won from the auctions of mine and you are dissatisfied with what
you have won you have the option as on my website in returning
the auctions. There is from time to time that a person does make
a selection and then when receives the item and then finds out
that it is not to their liking, you can return it the same as
from ordering materials from my website as long as it is not been
altered in anyway. We will refund your money that you have paid
for the item less the fees that has been paid for the auction
by me. This means that after the fees such as E-bay, Pay-Pal,
credit card payments even through Pay-Pal and etc. we will return
the balance upon receiving the auction or goods. At no time will
we pay for any shipping of any kind, sending or receiving in anyway
for any returned item.</P>
