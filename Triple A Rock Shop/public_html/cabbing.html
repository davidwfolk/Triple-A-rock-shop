		</div>
		<h3 class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="3">Over the past few months we have had the pleasure of cutting cabs and offering them to several designers that make a living at selling quality jewelry and asking for the best work possible. Since this has been a great success and the orders keep mounting and more designers are coming forth for our work and experience. Plus we have now merged with the employees of the old Tepee Rockshop and are working together to offer you this service. We here at the shop have under one roof, over 96 years of experience in our personnel and staff at performing this service to and for you. We would like to offer the same service to the public and other business's that require mass amounts of cabs made for their business purposes.<br>
				<br>
				We will take your pre-forms, calibrate and dome your cabochons from your material. We can do most sizes from 18x13 to 38x52 ovals and 15mm to 50mm rounds. All we ask is that you mark and snap out or trim saw the cabochon blanks and send them to us. The blanks must have at least 4mm of excess material and no more than 5mm overall as our cabbing machine works well with only that much excess. Anymore than this and we are wasting your valuable material. Then we can either finish them completely by tumble polishing or send them back for you to polish and finish. We do not do any hand polishing! We will require however, that there be at least 100 blanks as a minimum order of any one size. The following price list is based on material blanks that are 3/16 of an inch thickness and if your blanks are 1/4 inch thick, please add ten cents extra to each blank or stone.</font></h3>

from 12inch too 24 inch saws. We cannot however read the peoples
mind as to how they would like the material slabbed, so we take
the easiest way and slab from there and we slab it all. For this
part of the service we here at the shop charge $.50 per square
inch for slabing your material. This does not cover any shipping
and handling.<BR>
					If you want to have us slab and trim the blanks for you as to be cabbed by our machines, we charge $20.00 per hour to trim and prepare the blanks for cabbing. This is over and above the slabbing charge for the stones and all excess material and scraps will be returned to you packaged, unless you want to have us dispose of the scraps. We cannot read our clients minds and for orientations of the stones for the cabbing, we will cab as we see fit and to achieve the most cabs from the slabs that we cut or the slabs that you send unless so instructed.</font></CENTER></H3>
