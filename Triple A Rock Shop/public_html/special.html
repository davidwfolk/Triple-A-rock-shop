      SPECIAL #1<br>
      MORRISONITE JASPER ROUGH<br>
</strong><strong><font color="#ff0000"><big><big>SOLD OUT</big></big></font></strong><br>
<strong>
      For many years I have offered my Premium Morrisonite Jasper Rough at 50
      pounds for $4500.00 and paid for shipping and insurance. Even at this price
      is and
      was lower than the $300.00 a pound for Morrisonite that was offered at
      Quartzsite in the year 2008 and this year was even higher. This price was
      with material
      that was 40% jasper and 60% Rhyolite or host rock again this year at the
      Quartzsite shows. Since the economy is in turmoil and we are at the mercy
      of the financial issues and the fact that I&#8217;m selling out and quitting
      the business that prices now have changed here at the shop. Now since we
      are trying our best to sell our shop and home so as to move from our location
      here in Treasure Valley that I now make this offer one of our featured
      specials. I have four grades of Morrisonite rough for your interests. They
      are as follows,<br>
      ,<br></strong><strong><font color="#ff0000">SOLD OUT</font></strong><strong>
      Grade #1 is for the premium Morrisonite Jasper in a 25 pound sack which
      sizes are from the size of an egg to a tennis ball to as large as your
      fist or
      a little larger. This grade for a 25 pound sack was $2,500.00 and because
      of selling out that the premium Morrisonite material now in 25 pound lots
      is $1750.00 plus shipping and insurance. If you purchase 50 pound lots
      then the prices is $3,250.00 plus shipping and insurance so as to be protected
      while in transit. After selling this grade for the past 20 years my supply
      is limited and once it&#8217;s gone, &#8220;it&#8217;s gone&#8221;! There
      is at this publication approximately 800 pounds left out of 6,900 pounds
      I had in the year 2000.<br>
      .<br></strong><strong><font color="#ff0000">SOLD OUT</font></strong><strong>
      Grade#2 is Morrisonite pieces that are what I call just cabbing grade and
      they are in sizes from a quality chip to small pieces and some that are as
      large as your fist that will slab and will cut some great cabs for stone
      jewelry. This also is in 25 pound lots and again you will be responsible
      for shipping and insurance but, 25 pounds is just $ 1000.00 for some great
      material. There is approximately 1,500 pounds of this grade left after having
      some 4 ton back in the year 2000.<br>
      <br></strong><strong><font color="#ff0000">SOLD OUT</font></strong><strong>
      Grade #3 is what everyone wants which is the &#8220;Orbicular or Orbed&#8221; material
      and I have a small amount of this material left that needs a new home. This
      grade can be as small as a chip or have pieces smaller than an egg and as
      big as your fist but all are show some sort of orbs. I&#8217;m offering any
      amount at a price which is almost as low as it will get for the material.
      If you take and purchase 10 pounds the price is $1,600.00 and if you take
      25 pounds the price is $3,750.00 and if you purchase 50 pounds you can purchase
      at $6,250.00 and of course you&#8217;ll have to add the shipping and insurance.
      Take over the required amount in weights above and we can negotiate a price
      that we both can live with but remember the word here is selling and not
      giving it away because it is becoming rare to even have this grade of material.
      There is approximately 350 pounds of this grade left at the time of this
      publication where as in the year 2000 I had well over 2200 pounds.<br>
      <br>
      MORRISONITE CHIPS<br>
<span style="color: red;"></span></strong><strong><font color="#ff0000"><big><big>SOLD OUT</big></big> </font></strong><strong><span style="color: red;"></span><br>
      I also have some great chips still available in 10, 20 and 50 pound lots
      that will cut awesome free forms as well as calibrated stones up to 30x40
      cabs. The 10 pound lots are $200.00, 20 pound lots are $350.00 and then
      the 50 pound lots are $750.00 and this also means that you&#8217;ll be
      charged for shipping and insurance over and above the cost of the rock.
      There is
      some 500 pounds of this grade at the time of this publication and some
      of these chips are pieces that are from the premium and orbed grades also
      mixed
      in.<br>
      <br>
      SPECIAL #2<br>
      MORRISONITE JASPER PROVEN HEELS<br>
</strong><strong><font color="#ff0000"><big><big>SOLD OUT</big></big> </font></strong><br>
<strong>
      Over the years I have cut a lot of slabs of the very best of Morrisonite
      Premium Jasper and have saved a lot of the heels and now I have started
      to offer these to clients that have come to the shop. I have several heels
      that
      I am now making it known on the Net that they are now for sale and they
      will make some people go "gunny bag"! These absolute gorgeous
      pieces are in several sizes and weights and are now available if you e-mail
      and
      ask to see a few. Trust me that they will at least slab some 2-3 slabs
      and sometimes a little more depending upon the thickness of the heel. Prices
      did vary for each piece from $120.00 to $400.00 or more each piece and
      as
      always the more you buy the better the price or buy the two buckets that
      are left of these heels and will make a deal that you'll not be able to
      resist.<br>
      The heels are now half price!<br>
  Pictures will be sent upon request for your purchasing pleasure.<br>
  <br>
  SPECIAL #3<br>
  CHINESE DENDRATIC JASPER ROUGH<br>
  Chinese Dendratic Jasper has been great jasper to work with and sorry to say
  there isn&#8217;t anymore coming from the old mine as it is in a closed area
  of BLM. It is a material that holds many different patterns and shows why it
  was called such a name as for the patterns are like Chinese writings. Since we
  can&#8217;t get anymore of this material it is time to sell it and move on so
  while supply lasts you can get 25 pounds for $150.00, unless you want to purchase
  all that&#8217;s left, plus shipping and handling.<br>
  <br>
  SPECIAL #4<br>
  LABRADORITE ROUGH<br>
  The Labradorite material that we have offered is no longer at our ability to
  get from the supplier that promised "hand selected pieces" as he has
  called it quits! So from our vast amount of material is a great buy as before
  but now will be even better for those of you who take advantage of this special
  till it&#8217;s all gone at my cost. We have sold it before at $7.50 a pound
  and now you can buy all you want at a mere $5.00 a pound. Plus the S&amp;H
  till it is all gone.<br>
					<br>
					
  SPECIAL #6<br>
  MARSTON WOOD JASPER ROUGH<br>
  The Marston Wood Jasper is another great material as for colors and patterns
  and to think this was once wood but instead of keeping the wood grain as we
  all know with Petrified Wood, this turned to a jasper agate material. Again
  with
  these babies, as some are approaching some 60 pounds or more, that you had
  better have a 20-24-36 inch saw to slab this material as all the smaller ones
  are gone.
  It has been one of our best sellers because of selling the business I&#8217;m
  offering it at my cost at $4.00 a pound. Then you have shipping and handling
  as well as insurance to cover.<br>
  <br>
  SPECIAL #7<br>
  WILDHORSE PICTURE JASPER ROUGH<br>
</strong><strong><font color="#ff0000"><big><big>SOLD OUT</big></big></font></strong><br>
<strong>
  Talk of your old time favorites this is that material as it has been around
  for many years and still very popular. We have had several hundred pounds sold
  over
  the years and sorry to say that with the mine owners higher prices that we
  will not be getting anymore besides selling out and have a couple tons that
  needs
  to find a new home. So, while the pile lasts and since the price was $6.00
  a pound for this great jasper it is now if you buy 50 pounds at my cost it&#8217;s
  just $3.75 a pound plus the usual shipping and handling till it is gone. Last
  year from the mine this material was at best at $15.00 a pound for the low
  grade and this year has gone up again.<br>
  <br>
  SPECIAL #8<br>
  PURPLE SAGE AGATE ROUGH<br>
  One of our most popular agates, The Purple Sage Agate, has done us well but
  due to selling out the price for 25 pounds is a steal at $4.50 a pound while
  it lasts.
  We have some 2 ton of this marvelous material at this time to offer and I would
  like to sell what we have left. So, you can now buy in 50 pound lots and have
  it for $4.00 a pound and as always plus S&amp;H.<br>
  <br>
  SPECIAL #9<br>
  OWYHEE PICTURE JASPER<br>
This material is one of the old classics from our area and has been one
of the best materials to have in any collection or to make for some
awesome stone jewelry. I have two grades of this material which will do
good things for your hobby or business. The grade that is left is the
better grade material is at 50 pounds at a mere $750.00 which is what I
paid for it some 10 years ago. Shipping and insurance is always a must
and is above the purchase pricing.<br>
  <br>
  SPECIAL #10<br>
  BOTSWANA AGATE<br>
</strong><strong><font color="#ff0000"><big><big>SOLD OUT</big></big></font></strong><br>
<strong>In cleaning out one of the sheds where I had rock stored I uncovered some Botswana
  Agate that I had forgotten about over the years. When I say over the years
  I mean I haven&#8217;t seen this rock for some 20 years. They quit importing this
  material because of the uprising in that African Country about 20 years ago.
  I&#8217;ve seen some of this material lately and the price scares me as many
  are selling it from $40.00 - $55.00 a pound. If you buy 10 pounds of it you
  can purchase 10 pounds at $175.00 and if you buy 25 pounds then the price is
  $375.00
  and you have to also take care of the shipping and insurance.<br>
  <br>
  SPECIAL #11<br>
  BRUNEAU JASPER<br>
</strong><strong><font color="#ff0000"><big><big>SOLD OUT</big></big> </font></strong><br>
<strong>
  I have a few pounds left of some great Bruneau Jasper left and has always been
  a great seller for us ever since I bought a ton of it back in 1992. Our standard
  color Bruneau which was the caramel with cream colored orbs was at $37.50 a
  pound which is below the prices in today&#8217;s market when we started to
  sell out. Purchase 10 pounds or more and get it at $35.00 a pound now and if
  25 pounds
  is purchased the price is now at my cost which was $30.00 a pound. Purchase
  what is left and will make a better deal for the serious buyer. I also have
  some of
  the exotic and blacks left but very short numbers. If you purchase 10 pounds
  that rather than paying $70.00 a pound that the price for 10 pounds or more
  is now $45.00 a pound and yet a better price if you purchase all that remains.
  Then
  as usual you must consider the shipping and insurance.<font color="#ff0000"><br>
  </font><br>
  SPECIAL #12<br>
  PRIDAY RANCH<br>
  THUNDER EGGS<br>
  For many years I was always fascinated with the Priday Ranch Thunder Egg Plume
  where if by chance you got an egg that would produce slabs showing some beautiful
  and colorful plumes. When ever I was able to get to the Richardson Ranch (formally
  Priday Ranch) and either dug or bought these little beauties I would always
  go over board on the material. It wasn&#8217;t till a few years into this business
  I learned that the rule of thumb in getting an egg to show plumes was one out
  of one hundred. That didn&#8217;t stop me from buying. Now I have several hundred
  pounds of these great eggs and they have to go. So, if you buy 20 pounds of
  them the price is $100.00 and if 50 pounds is purchased the price for 50 pounds
  is
  what I paid for the material which was $4.50 a pound and then again shipping
  and insurance.<br>
  I also have several hundred pounds of the Priday Ranch Thunder Eggs that were
  chipped showing some gorgeous colored moss. If just a few pounds the cost is
  $6.50 a pound and if 25 pounds or more is purchased the price $5.50 a pound which
  was my cost.<br>
  <br>
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  <br>
  Since the amount of rock that I have is so vast in tonnage that maybe you&#8217;ll
  find something in the list below that could interest you. Please inquire if there
  is something you want as many items maybe as much as 50% off or even at my cost.
  The numbers after the name of the material is the approximate poundage of what
  I have on hand at the time of this publication. The first price is when you buy
  just a few pounds, the second price is by 5, 10, 25 and 50 pound lots minimum
  or as stated and the last price per line is if you buy it all. Just remember
  that I am not affiliated with E-bay as I will not sell $50.00 a pound material
  for 50 cents a pound and cover the S&amp;H&amp;I in the price. I&#8217;m selling
  and the thought of giving it away has not or will it ever be considered or
  tolerated.<br>
