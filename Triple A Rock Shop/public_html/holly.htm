<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center"><CENTER>Holly Blue
Chalcedony is one of the most favored materials from the Northwest
of today's jewelers outside of the Ellensburg Blue Chalcedony.
Holly Blue was found in the hills around Sweet Home, Oregon till
a major timber company bought all the surrounding land where this
material was found and made it private property with NO TRESPASSING
of any kind for what ever reason. This hurt the rock hound community
as this was a material with such vibrant colors that ranged for
a light blue to an almost lavender in color. Holly could fetch
from $5.00 per pound to $35.00 a pound back in the days when the
material was still being dug. Today, it's going from $35.00 per
pound and upwards of $400.00 and $500.00 per pound for the choicer
grade of this excellent material. As for the cut stones, either
faceted or cabed, the stones are sold by the carat and fetch an
excellent price for the hobbyist or the professional jeweler.
It was not uncommon to attend a gem show at a local west coast
city and find pounds of this material on dealers tables for just
a couple of bucks. Now days the material is rarely seen in the
average gem shows in the rough for sale and if you find any, it
has been cut into cabs that have grown very expensive.<BR>
The material is of a quartz makeup and is a very hard material
and being of the quartz family it takes a mirror polish and the
higher domes of the cabs bring the most money. The material is
almost always fractured as for the ground movement when this material
was being formed. It is the custom that when you got the rough
with the outer rhyolite that it was to be tumbled to get the outer
crust off and then you were able to see the fracture lines and
brake the larger chunks down to smaller ones that would then be
free of the fractures. Sometimes the old timers would then go
ahead and tumble the pieces to a mirror polish as then the most
discrete of cutters could see what they were buying. This was
always the case and with some dealers is still being practiced
today.<BR>
 Here at the shop we are carrying on that tradition in what we
have in Holley Blue and have purchased some of the west coasts
finest materials from a couple of the old time dealers that majored
in this excellent material. Our supply is limited and our hopes
are that we will have some for a while for your enjoyment to purchase
for your jewelry needs.</CENTER></P>
